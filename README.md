## Start using the template
To start using the template click on `Use this Template`.

The template uses html for controlling the content and css for controlling the style. 
To edit the websites contents edit the `index.html` file. It contains different HTML "building blocks", use whichever ones you need and comment out the rest.  

**IMPORTANT!** Make sure to replace the `favicon.ico` under `static/images/` with one of your own, otherwise your favicon is going to be a dreambooth image of me.

## Components
- Teaser video
- Images Carousel
- Youtube embedding
- Video Carousel
- PDF Poster
- Bibtex citation

## Tips:
- The `index.html` file contains comments instructing you what to replace, you should follow these comments.
- The `meta` tags in the `index.html` file are used to provide metadata about your paper 
(e.g. helping search engine index the website, showing a preview image when sharing the website, etc.)
- The resolution of images and videos can usually be around 1920-2048, there rarely a need for better resolution that take longer to load. 
- All the images and videos you use should be compressed to allow for fast loading of the website (and thus better indexing by search engines). For images, you can use [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com), for videos you can need to find the tradeoff between size and quality.
- When using large video files (larger than 10MB), it's better to use youtube for hosting the video as serving the video from the website can take time.
- Using a tracker can help you analyze the traffic and see where users came from. [statcounter](https://statcounter.com) is a free, easy to use tracker that takes under 5 minutes to set up. 
- This project page can also be made into a github pages website.
- Replace the favicon to one of your choosing (the default one is of the Hebrew University). 
- Suggestions, improvements and comments are welcome, simply open an issue or contact me. You can find my contact information at [https://horwitz.ai](https://horwitz.ai)
